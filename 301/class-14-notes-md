# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

**What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**

- At the same time that the number of women studying computer science started to decrease, personal computers became popular in American households. These computers were mostly seen as toys for boys and men. This shift in computer availability and perception happened around the 1980s, which coincided with fewer women choosing to study computer science.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

- The fact that boys had access to and played with computers at a young age made a big difference when they reached college. Many computer science professors assumed that students had experience with computers, which put female students at a disadvantage if they hadn't used computers much before college. Families were more likely to buy computers for boys, even if girls were interested. This led to a gap where male students were more prepared and confident in computer science classes compared to female students who didn't have as much early exposure. This gap affected the success and confidence of female students like Patricia Ordóñez, who faced challenges in her computer science classes due to this difference in early computer experience.

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**

- Diversity efforts work best when company leaders are committed to them. Leaders need to understand why diversity and inclusion matter specifically for their company.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**

- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative because they bring different perspectives to solving problems. Research shows that diverse companies also tend to have better financial outcomes.

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vice versa**

- A diverse company can serve its users better when its employees reflect the diversity of those users. For instance, when YouTube's team was mostly right-handed, they overlooked how left-handed users would interact with their app, leading to technical issues. Similarly, if Twitter had more diversity in its teams, they might develop more engaging features for Black/African users.
