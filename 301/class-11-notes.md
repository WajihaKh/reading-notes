# MongoDB and Mongoose

__Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases__:

**SQL:**

- Uses tables with fixed structure and supports complex queries
- Scales vertically by adding more resources to a single server
- Good for complex queries with joins across table
- Required predefined schemas for structured data
- Emphasizes ACID properties

**NoSQL:**

- Offers flexbility with various data models like document, key value pairs, or graphs, without strict schemas
- Scales horizontally by adding more servers to handle increased load
- Limited in cmplex query capabilities, focusing on simpler queries otimized for specific data models
- Supports dynamic schemas, suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data that requires flexibility and scalability.

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

Structured data with well defined relationships and schemas.

**Give a real world example.**

Financial transactions, inventory management systems, customer relationship management database.

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

Unstructured or semi-structured data that requires flexbility and scalability.

**Give a real world example.**

Social media analytics

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

Besy for hierachical data storage is NoSQL database.

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

Best for scalability is NoSQL database.

**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language.

**What is a relational database?**

A relational database organzies data into tables, where each table represents a specific entity or relationship.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

SQL works best with relational database.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

'Schema' is like a blueprint that defines how data is organized and structured within the database.

**What is a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL database is stores lots of data in an efficient way.

**How does it work?**

NoSQL has flexible data models, horiztonal scalability, high performance: optimized for speed.

**What is inside of a MongoDB database?**

Inside of a MongoDB database is organized into collections:

- Collection
- Document
- Fields
- Indexes

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

The choice depends on the projects specificied requirements. SQL is good for applications needing strong data consistency and complex quieries with well defined relationships. While MongoDB is suitable for applications with changing data structures, scalability needs and where speed is crucial.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is their limited querying capabilities compared to SQL. NoSQL lacks support for complex querying, which makes it challenging to perform complex data analysis and reporting task. Managing data consistency and integrity with NoSQL can be more complex due to its flexible schema and eventual consistency models.
