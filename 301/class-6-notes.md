__Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?__

The techniques we learn in class aren't suited for talking to all machines globally. These methods were designed for communicating with a limited number of machines, not the entire internet. For effective communication with all machines, we need universal naming such as URLS and standardized actions verbs like GET, PUT, DELETE, that all machines understand. This approach, inspired by REST principles, ensures compatibility and facilitates communication across diverse systems.
