# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Explain why we need domain modeling

We need domain modeling because it helps under the problem. Allows others to work on the problem easily.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Tables should not be used for page layouts because it reduces accessibility for visually impaired users. Tables are harder to write and maintain and lastly they are not automatically responsive such as the width of the tablt depends on the content.

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML '<'table'>'

- '<'thead'>' table head is the tables header with column headings
-'<'tbody'>' keeps the main content of the table
-'<'tfoot'>' tables footer

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor is a function called when using 'new'. Some advantages are it creates a new object. Binds 'this' to the new object, runs the code in the constuctor and returns the new object.

## How does the term 'this' differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

'This' differs when used in an object literal vs a constructor because when you use 'this' in an object literal it refers to the object itself but in a constructor it refers to the instance of the object being created.

## Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience

Prototypes and inheritance allow for effience reuse. For example if a chef of a restaurant wants to create a new menu from different cuisine, they would make a basic menu with common dishes. Tweaking the dish with unique ingrdients. This would allow them to reuse the recipes while making it easier for them to add new option.
