# PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Three key factors contributing to psychologically safe teams:
    a. __Equality__ in conversational turn-taking ensures all voices are heard during discussions, encourages inclusivity and diversity of perspectives. When team members feel valued and respected, they are more likely to contribute freely and engage in collaborative problem-solving.
    b. __High average__ social sensitivity encourages empathy and trust among team members, leading to stronger relationships and a supportive work environment. When team members are adjusted to each other's emotions and needs, they can offer mutual support, resolve conflicts, and navigate challenges effectively.
    c. __Openness__ to sharing personal experiences promotes authenticity and deeper connections within the team. When team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of judgment, it creates a culture of vulnerability and trust. This openness makes easier genuine communication, strengthens bonds, and enhances teamwork.

1. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

In a previous retail job, a confrontational co-worker created a tense atmosphere, impacting psychological safety. Despite reporting the behavior to our supervisor, there was no resolution, leaving us feeling unsupported. The supervisor's inaction contributed to a lack of trust and discomfort among the team, making it challenging to form genuine connections. Feeling isolated and disconnected, I ultimately decided to quit a few days later. The unresolved conflict and absence of a supportive environment made it impossible to continue working there. This experience highlights the importance of addressing conflicts and encouraging psychological safety in the workplace to ensure employees feel valued and respected.

- Enhanced employee well-being and satisfaction: Psychological safety promotes a positive work environment where team members feel valued, respected, and supported, leading to greater job satisfaction, reduced stress, and increased morale.

This enables organizations to stay competitive and thrive in dynamic environments.
