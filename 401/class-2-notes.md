# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

    **Middleware is like a bridge that helps different software systems communicate and work together smoothly, kind of like a translator at a meeting.**

2. Express the most popular __.

    **Express is the most popular web framework for node.js**

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

    **Express being "unopinionated" means it gives developers a lot of freedom and flexibility in how they structure their code and build their applications.**

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

    **A module is like a small piece of code that does a specific task. Modularity helps us as developers because it makes our code easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.

5. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

    **I'm not able to check the version of npm on your machine, but you can find out by typing "npm -v" in your terminal or command prompt.**

6. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

    **To install the 'jshint' library/package into your node project, you would type "npm install jshint" in your terminal or command prompt.**

7. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

    **Tests are important because they help ensure that our software works correctly and reliably, like double-checking that the stove is off before leaving the house.**

8. What are three expected benefits of testing

    **Three benefits of testing are catching bugs early, improving code quality, and increasing confidence in the software's behavior.**

9. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

    **Two individual pitfalls in writing tests are writing tests that are too complex or too simple. Two team pitfalls are inconsistent testing practices and neglecting to update tests when code changes.**

10. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

    **Three benefits of Continuous Integration are detecting integration issues early, speeding up the development process, and providing rapid feedback to developers.**

11. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

    **Continuous Delivery means automatically deploying code changes to a testing or staging environment after passing tests, while Continuous Deployment means automatically deploying code changes to production after passing tests.**

12. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

    **GitHub is like a shared workspace where developers store and collaborate on code. It fits into the Continuous Integration process by providing version control, issue tracking, and tools for automated testing and deployment.**
