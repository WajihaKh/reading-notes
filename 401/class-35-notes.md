# Graphs

Imagine a city with buildings connected by roads:

- **Undirected Graph**: Roads allow travel in both directions, like two-way streets.
- **Directed Graph**: Roads are one-way, guiding traffic in specific directions.
- **Complete Graph**: Every building has a direct road to every other building.
- **Connected Graph**: You can reach any building from any other building.
- **Disconnected Graph**: Some buildings are isolated without roads to others.
- **Acyclic Graph**: Roads form a path without loops or circular routes.
- **Cyclic Graph**: Roads create loops where you can return to your starting point.

Graphs model complex relationships, used in GPS, social networks, and more.
