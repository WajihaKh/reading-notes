# Access Control (ACL)

1. **What's Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why should we care?**

   RBAC is a system where different users have different levels of access to resources based on their role in an organization. It's important because it helps keep sensitive information secure and ensures that only authorized users can access certain data.

2. **Can you describe a Role/Permission setup you might use with RBAC?**

   You could have roles like admin, manager, and employee. Admins would have full access, managers might have access to certain tools and reports, and employees might have access to their own data but not sensitive company-wide information.

3. **How would you go about setting up RBAC?**

   First, you'd identify the different roles within your organization. Then, you'd define what each role needs access to. Finally, you'd assign users to their respective roles based on their responsibilities.

4. **If Authentication is proving who you are, what's Authorization?**

   Authorization is what happens after you prove who you are. It's when the system decides what you're allowed to do based on your role or permissions.

5. **What are three big rules for RBAC?**

   - Assign roles based on job responsibilities.
   - Define what each role can access.
   - Ensure users can only access what their role permits.

6. **Explain RBAC to a friend who's not into tech.**

   It's like having different levels of access at work. The boss might have access to everything, while regular employees only have access to what they need to do their job.

7. **Are access rights connected to users or roles?**

   Access rights are tied to roles. Users get access based on the role they're assigned.

8. **When do Access Rights kick in?**

   Access rights kick in after a user successfully logs in or proves their identity. Once they're in, the system checks their role and grants appropriate access.

9. **How could RBAC help a business?**

   RBAC helps businesses manage who can access what information, which is crucial for security and privacy. It also streamlines access management, making it easier to control who has access to sensitive data and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
