# React Native

**1. View**

The `View` component is like a `div` in HTML; it acts as a container for other components and views.

**2. Text**

The `Text` component is used for displaying text on the screen, similar to the `p` tag in HTML.

**3. Image**

The `Image` component is used to display images, similar to the `img` tag in HTML.

**Problem Solved by React Native**

React Native allows developers to write mobile apps using JavaScript and React, enabling the creation of apps that work on both iOS and Android with a single codebase.

**Building Blocks of a React Native App**

React Native apps are built with components, similar to React apps, but they use native components instead of web components.

**Solution Provided by Expo**

Expo simplifies the development process by providing tools and services that handle many aspects of app development, making it easier to build and deploy apps.

Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the **managed** workflow.

**Difference Between React Native and Expo**

React Native is the core framework for building native apps using React, while Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native to streamline development.

**What Snack Allows You to Do**

Snack is an online editor provided by Expo that allows you to write, run, and share React Native code directly in your browser.

**Meaning of "Eject" in the Context of Expo**

"Ejecting" means converting your Expo project to a standard React Native project, giving you full control but also more responsibility for configuration.

**When You Should Not Eject**

You should not eject if you do not need custom native code and prefer the simplicity and managed services provided by Expo.

**Why You Might Choose to Eject**

You might choose to eject if you need to add custom native modules or make configurations not supported by the Expo managed workflow.
