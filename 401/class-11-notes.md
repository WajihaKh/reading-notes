# Event Driven Applications;

1. **What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**
   
   The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event-Driven Programming is called EventEmitter.

2. **What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**
   
   Object Oriented Programming (OOP) used with Event Driven Programming (EDP) creates modular, scalable, and maintainable code. OOP encapsulates behavior within objects, making it easier to manage and understand complex systems. When combined with EDP, OOP allows streamlined communication between objects by using events to trigger actions, reducing coupling between components and promoting reusability.

3. **Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**
   
   Event Driven Programming in Node.js, similar to web browsers, handles actions asynchronously. For instance, in a chat application, when a user sends a message, Node.js can use event-driven architecture to handle that action without waiting for each message to be sent or received before handling other tasks. This results in a more responsive and scalable application.

4. **Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
   
   Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, I look forward to diving deeper into advanced topics such as asynchronous programming, data modeling, and exploring different databases and frameworks for backend development.

5. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
   
   After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals include mastering fundamental concepts of backend development with Node.js, understanding best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications, and gaining practical experience through hands-on projects and exercises provided throughout the course.
