# API Integration

Middleware in Express.js processes incoming requests before they reach route handlers. Hereâ€™s how you could implement basic and bearer authentication using middleware:

- **Basic Authentication Middleware**:
  - Verify credentials in the `Authorization` header.
  - Validate against user database.
  - Attach user information to `req.user` if valid; otherwise, respond with 401 Unauthorized.

- **Bearer Authentication Middleware**:
  - Verify JWT token from the `Authorization` header.
  - Decode and attach user details to `req.user` if valid; otherwise, respond with 401 Unauthorized.

**OAuth Handshake**

OAuth involves:
- User initiates authentication.
- Authorization grant with consent.
- Token exchange for access token.
- Access protected resources using the obtained token.

**Role Based Access Control (RBAC)**

RBAC restricts network access based on user roles:
- Roles define sets of permissions.
- Users are assigned roles.
- Authorization checks roles against required permissions.
- Allows or denies access based on permissions.
