# Linked Lists

Analogy for Linked List

Image your have a train, where each train car is connected to the next through a coupling. Each train car holds some cargo. The first car in the train is called the head, and the last car is called the tail. In a linked list, each train car represents a node, and the cargo inside the car represents the data stored in the node. The coupling between the train cars represents the link or reference to the next node in the list. Just like in a linked list, you can start at the head and traverse through each car by following the couplings. You can access the cargo in each car as you pass by. The tail car indicates the end of the list and signifies that there are no more nodes to visits.
