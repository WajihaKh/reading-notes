# Context API - Behaviors

**How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application?**

In React applications, `useReducer` and `useContext` collaborate to streamline state management. `useReducer` consolidates state update logic into a single function, enhancing maintainability by centralizing state modifications. Components dispatch actions to the reducer, which computes the new state based on the current state and the dispatched action. This approach promotes predictability and scalability, particularly in large applications where state management complexity can escalate.

Meanwhile, `useContext` facilitates the consumption of shared data or functions across components without the need for prop drilling. By creating context providers, components gain access to shared state or actions, eliminating the tedious process of passing props down through every level of the component tree. When combined, `useReducer` and `useContext` offer a powerful solution for managing state in React applications, enhancing code modularity, reusability, and scalability.
