**What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?**

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of controlling network access based on individuals' roles within an organization. It assigns access permissions to roles rather than individual users, ensuring that employees only have access to the resources necessary for their specific job duties.

**Example of RBAC with CRUD Operations and Correlating Roles:**

In an RBAC system, different roles are assigned specific permissions for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on organizational resources. For instance:

- **Administrator Role:** Full control over users, files, and system configurations.
- **Manager Role:** Permission to manage projects and user permissions within their department.
- **Employee Role:** Access to relevant project files and the ability to create tasks.
- **Guest Role:** Limited read-only access to public information.

**Benefits of RBAC:**

1. **Enhanced Security:** RBAC minimizes unauthorized access by restricting users to necessary resources.
2. **Efficiency:** Aligned access permissions improve productivity by reducing unnecessary access restrictions.
3. **Compliance:** RBAC aids in meeting regulatory requirements by controlling data access.
4. **Simplified Administration:** Centralized management streamlines user role and permission changes.
5. **Scalability:** RBAC systems adapt to organizational growth and changes in job roles effectively.
