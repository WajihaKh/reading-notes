# Express REST API

1. Classes are a template for creating ____.

    **Classes are a template for creating objects.**

2. Can a class declaration be hoisted?

    **No, class declarations are not hoisted in JavaScript.**

3. How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?

    **A constructor is like a special function inside a class that helps create and set up objects. "this" refers to the current object being created or used.**

4. Within Express, what does routing refer to?

    **In Express, routing refers to directing incoming requests to different parts of the application based on the request URL and method.**

5. What is the difference between a route path and a route method?

    **A route path is the URL pattern that the server listens for, while a route method is the HTTP method (like GET, POST, etc.) used for the request.**

6. When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?

    **It's appropriate to add "next" as a parameter to a route handler when you want to pass control to the next middleware or route handler in the stack. If "next" is passed to your middleware, you must call it to pass control to the next middleware in line.**

7. What is an Express Router?

    **An Express Router is like a mini Express application that helps organize route handlers and middleware into separate files or modules.**

8. By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?

    **We initialize express.Router() by calling it as a function, like this: "const router = express.Router();"**

9. What do we use route middleware for?

    **We use route middleware to perform tasks like authentication, logging, or data validation before passing control to the route handler.**

10. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

    **After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals may include understanding the class objectives, grasping key concepts, practicing coding exercises, and applying what I've learned to real-world projects.**
