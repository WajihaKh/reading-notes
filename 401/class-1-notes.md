# Node Ecosystem

**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**

    1. Node.js is a tool that lets developers use JavaScript outside of web browsers, allowing them to create server-side applications like servers, APIs, and desktop applications.

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**

    2. Node being a JavaScript runtime means it provides the environment needed to run JavaScript code on a computer outside of a web browser, similar to how a video player runs video files.

**What is Node used for?**

    3. Node is used for building scalable, real-time applications such as chat applications, streaming services, and APIs that handle multiple requests simultaneously.
