# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

**What is Amazon API Gateway?**
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

**Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?**
Amazon API Gateway acts as the front door for serverless applications, enabling seamless integration with backend services and allowing developers to build scalable and secure APIs without managing infrastructure.

**How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?**
API Gateway integrates with various AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon S3, allowing developers to create powerful serverless architectures by connecting APIs to backend services effortlessly.

**What are some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?**
Some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway include easy API creation and management, automatic scaling to handle any amount of traffic, built-in security features like authentication and authorization, and seamless integration with AWS services.

**What two API types might you choose from?**
You might choose between RESTful APIs, which use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and WebSocket APIs, which enable real-time communication between clients and servers over WebSocket connections.

**What is DynamoDB?**
DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS, designed to provide fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

**Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?**
I would recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB when you need seamless scalability and low-latency performance for applications with unpredictable workloads or high read/write throughput requirements.

**Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.**
DynamoDB is like a magical bookshelf where you can store and retrieve your books (data) very quickly. It automatically adjusts to hold as many books as you need, so you never run out of space, and you can find your books instantly whenever you need them.

**What is Dynamoose?**
Dynamoose is an open-source modeling tool for Amazon DynamoDB in JavaScript, designed to simplify interactions with DynamoDB by providing a simple and familiar interface.

**What are some key features of Dynamoose?**
Some key features of Dynamoose include schema-based modeling, type validation, easy querying and indexing, support for migrations, hooks for lifecycle events, and seamless integration with AWS SDK for DynamoDB.
