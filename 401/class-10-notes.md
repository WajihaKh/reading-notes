# Stacks and Queues

### Stacks Cheat Sheet:

**What is a Stack**:

- A stack is a data structure consisting of Nodes.
- Each Node references the next Node in the stack but not its previous.

**Common Operations**:

- **Push:** Adding Nodes or items to the stack.
- **Pop:** Removing Nodes or items from the stack.
- **Peek:** Viewing the value of the top Node without removing it.
- **IsEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.

**Principles**:

- Follows FILO (First In Last Out) or LIFO (Last In First Out) principles.

**Time Complexity**:
- Pushing and Popping are O(1) operations, regardless of the number of items in the stack.

### Queue Cheat Sheet:

**What is a Queue:**
- A queue is a data structure where Nodes or items are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).

**Common Operations:**
- **Enqueue:** Adding Nodes or items to the queue.
- **Dequeue:** Removing Nodes or items from the queue.
- **Peek:** Viewing the value of the front Node without removing it.
- **IsEmpty:** Checking if the queue is empty.

**Principles:**
- Follows FIFO (First In First Out) or LILO (Last In Last Out) principles.

**Time Complexity:**
- Enqueuing and Dequeuing are O(1) operations, regardless of the number of items in the queue.
